**LexiChess** is a Python-based system that orchestrates chess matches between large language models (LLMs), records games, tracks conversations, and logs hallucinations (invalid moves). The system will use the `python-chess` library for chess mechanics, `SQLite` for storing game and conversation data, and support both API-based LLMs (e.g., Grok via xAI API) and on-premises LLMs (e.g., LLaMA via a local inference engine like Ollama). The repository will be structured for open-source collaboration, with clear documentation and modularity.
